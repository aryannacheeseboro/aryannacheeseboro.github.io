<h2>Grunge Meets Glam</h2>
<p>The 1990s were a decade of contrasts, with grunge and minimalism battling it out for dominance. Flannel shirts, ripped jeans, and combat boots became staples of the grunge aesthetic, popularized by bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam. Plaid patterns and muted colors like forest green, burgundy, and navy ruled the streets, creating a laid-back, “don’t care” vibe. On the other end of the spectrum, slip dresses and sheer fabrics offered a touch of elegance, blending the casual with the chic.</p>

    <h2>Pop Culture Pop-Offs</h2>
    <p>The rise of supermodels and pop stars shaped the fashion scene in the 90s. Think Kate Moss rocking Calvin Klein’s minimalist looks or TLC making baggy jeans and crop tops the ultimate cool-girl outfit. Bright neon windbreakers and matching tracksuits became synonymous with the sporty aesthetic, fueled by brands like Adidas and Nike. Logos were everywhere—whether you were wearing Tommy Hilfiger, FUBU, or Guess, flaunting the brand was a must.</p>

    <h2>Streetwear & Sneakerheads</h2>
    <p>Hip-hop culture took center stage in the 90s, bringing oversized pants, gold chains, and snapback hats to mainstream fashion. Sneakers like the Air Jordan 11 or Reebok Pumps became more than just shoes—they were status symbols. Meanwhile, cargo pants and bucket hats offered a functional yet stylish touch to everyday outfits. Streetwear was all about attitude, and the clothes told a story of self-expression and urban influence.</p>

<h2>The Butterfly Clip Craze</h2>
<p>Butterfly hair clips were the accessory for girls in the 90s. Whether you were heading to a middle school dance or just hanging out at the mall, no hairstyle was complete without at least a dozen brightly colored clips fluttering in your hair. Talk about a “clip-tastic” trend!</p>
