<h2>Big Hair, Bold Statements</h2>
<p>The 1980s were all about making a splash, and fashion was no exception. With bold colors, oversized silhouettes, and plenty of glitz, the 80s embraced maximalism like no other decade. Neon hues like hot pink, electric blue, and lime green were everywhere, from workout gear to streetwear. Power dressing took center stage as women in the workplace embraced shoulder pads, creating a sharp, confident silhouette that said, “I mean business.” On the casual side, ripped jeans paired with graphic tees and leather jackets became iconic, thanks in part to rock stars and rebellious youth.</p>

    <h2>Material Girls and Mall Rats</h2>
    <p>Pop culture heavily influenced 80s fashion, with stars like Madonna setting trends. Lace gloves, corset tops, and layered necklaces were staples for those chasing that "Like a Virgin" look. Meanwhile, acid-wash jeans, scrunchies, and Members Only jackets were must-haves for mall-goers. The fitness craze also left its mark, with spandex leggings, leg warmers, and off-the-shoulder sweatshirts crossing over from the gym to everyday life. These outfits weren’t just functional—they were a statement of vibrant, active living.</p>

    <h2>Dudes in Denim and Rocker Chic</h2>
    <p>For the guys, denim ruled supreme. Double denim—dubbed the "Canadian tuxedo"—was a popular choice, with faded or stone-washed finishes taking the lead. Leather jackets and studded belts brought a touch of rebellion, while preppier gents sported pastel polos with popped collars. The music scene played a massive role in shaping these styles, from the glam rock glitz of sequined blazers to the punk rock grit of shredded shirts and Doc Martens.</p>
